# Wingmate

Wingmate is an FOSS project that lets people who cannot speak, get an actually great voice via Azure Neural Voices.

Wingman is currently developed by me, Jonas Drei√∏e, who has CP and used to have a Rolltalk, then a GridPad, then a Tobii i-13 speech device. The current Tobii Windows PC cost ~50k DKK (for touch only), has a 7. gen intel processor, is so slow and has a program UI that feels like it was from Vista-era. GridPad was constantly crashing due to their program being 32-bit (in 2023) and was super slow, but felt more modern in its UX (more like Windows 7). Rolltalk stopped development in 2020, had a XP-era UI and was super buggy. So, in September of 2024, I decided to make my own AAC-program. I wanted to make it open source, so we can develop a better user-experience together!

Since it's now using Flutter, the app is able to be built cross platform.

The app is in _VERY_ early stages

## Planned features:
- Save sentences & categories - early 2025
- Cache sentences - early 2025
- Offline (backup) voices - mid 2025
- Recgonition of hand gestures (LONG TERM PLAN)
- Subscription in addition to DYI setup 

## How to setup (the DYI version):

- Install the app
- Make a free Microsoft Azure account (portal.azure.com) 
- Create a Speech Resource (F0 = 500k free characters a month - that's enough for me)
- Add the region & key to the "Profile" dialog in the app
- Choose your voice in the Settings-page & select your primary language if it'a a multilingual voice.
