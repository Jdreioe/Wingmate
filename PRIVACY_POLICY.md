# Privacy Policy for Wingmate

**Last Updated: January 25, 2026**

Wingmate ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

### 1.1 Local Data
The majority of the data you create or store in Wingmate stays on your device. This includes:
- **Phrases and Categories**: Any text you save for quick access.
- **Speech History**: A record of the text you have asked the App to speak.
- **Prediction Model**: A mathematical model (n-grams) built from your speech history to provide word and letter suggestions. This model is generated and stored locally on your device.
- **Pronunciation Dictionary**: Custom pronunciations you have defined.
- **App Settings**: Your preferences for voice, language, and UI scaling.

### 1.2 External Services (Text-to-Speech)
Wingmate uses third-party services to convert text into speech:
- **Microsoft Azure Speech Services**: When you use voices provided by Azure, the text you enter is sent to Microsoft's servers to be processed into audio. This data is handled according to Microsoft's privacy and data retention policies.
- **System Voices**: If you use your device's built-in text-to-speech engine, data handling is subject to your operating system's privacy policy (e.g., Google's on Android, Apple's on iOS).

## 2. Data Storage
All data mentioned in Section 1.1 is stored in a local SQLite database on your device. We do not have access to this data, nor do we sync it to our own servers.

## 3. Data Sharing
- **Manual Sharing**: You can choose to share audio files generated by the App using your device's system share sheet or by copying them to the clipboard.
- **No Third-Party Selling**: We do not sell or trade your data to third parties.

## 4. Your Rights
Since your data is stored locally, you have full control over it:
- **Access and Correction**: You can view and edit your phrases and settings within the App.
- **Deletion**: You can clear your speech history or delete saved phrases at any time. Uninstalling the App will typically remove all locally stored data.

## 5. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer.
